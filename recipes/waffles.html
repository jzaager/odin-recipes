  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups/240 grams all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon/15 grams sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon/8 grams baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon/5 grams fine sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon/3 grams baking soda</li>
      <li>1 cup plain yogurt*</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>*Note: </em>If you donâ€™t have yogurt (or sour cream or buttermilk will all work), substitute another 1 cup of milk mixed with 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar.</p>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter either on the stove or in the microwave. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a separate bowl, whisk together yogurt, milk, melted butter, and eggs. Fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients.</li>
      <li>Preheat a waffle iron and, using a pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat with butter. Cook waffles (using about 1/2 cup batter per waffle) until golden and crisp. Butter the iron in between batches as needed. Serve waffles immediately as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200 degree oven until ready to serve.</li>
